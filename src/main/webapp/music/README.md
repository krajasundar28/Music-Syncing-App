This directory would contain your MP3 files. 
For testing purposes, add some MP3 files here and update the file paths in DataStore.java accordingly.

You can use any MP3 files you own or create empty placeholder files with the following names:
- sample1.mp3
- sample2.mp3
- sample3.mp3
- sample4.mp3
- sample5.mp3

If you have real MP3 files, rename them to match these filenames or update the paths in DataStore.java.
